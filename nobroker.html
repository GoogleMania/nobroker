<h1 style="background-color:red;"> Nobroker.in</h1>
<p style="color:yellow;"> Products used: My experience went very bad which never happened before with other packer movers. I was completely exhausted and frustrated with the poor ...<br>
very bad need to change work policy. looking for opportunity but didnt find ... Nobroker is a very good company, we can make money as monthly incentives and ...<br>
You can't think of future in this company, they can terminate you by giving any reason either for performance, behavior, or they blame you for some things just to hire new ones on less salary or just for cost cutting, they don't even respond when you get stuck in some critical situations during job, such a thief company is Nobroker just because of their management, they hire some kids in management who are just dumb and don't know how take decisions, just act abnormally, every week they launch new rules and regulations for employees, new work structures, incentives structure, they don't even know what they are doing . I have the worst experience over their, regretting working for them.
There is no timing, they can call you anytime and give some random task. They lie to customers just to close the leads and increase the business than we have to tackle the customers after sales to provide services possible.</p><br><br>

This is the worst company to work in fraud management and department i.e investment advisory to be specific they will make you work like a donkey over there,if you are a chattu employee then even if you will take unplanned leaves they will get approved but if a person is seriously having any kind of health they will not let you take leave they will pressurize you and the work politics is so bad over here they didn't even cleared my fnf and asking for 10 k more for the relieving letter. The manager as well the director are the worst people PLEASE DON'T WORK IN THIS COMPANY.<br>Everything, work culture, people behaviour, no protocol, no employee satisfaction<br><br>
No job security, I was terminated by the company without any prior notice.<br><br>
Dirty politics, incentive not given on time,worst hr management<br><br>
there is nothing learn new things and there is no good enviornment to work first they dont know how to encourage the employes and they dont take care about employee feelings<br>
<i><b>I was tenant relationship manager ..I am very unhappy with their work policy , before selection they used to take kc test . Where most of the questions they give are very difficult ,even they didn't teach well that in training ...<mark> They promised that they ll pay good incentive upto 10-15k ,but their work culture is so worst no one can earn that good amount of incentive due to their some unachievable targets ..</mark>n the seniors used to pressurise so bad like team head and team leader that even they call u on unusual times they don't care for ur lunch time ..n they told that logout time is 7 pm but they pressurise to work until 9pm to 10 pm until target achieved ..if u didn't achieve they used to target to blame u even after working hours ... No work life balance ... N seniors scold u if u didn't achieve their impossible target .. management is worst so is the work culture .n politics n favouritism is also their for growth and promotion... N they have that policy if u unable to achieve their target ,i work for many months still being the best performer ,they put me in pip ..n due to bad work culture many employees leave after every 1&2 month .. they should improve work culture and should be deduct employee salary due to silly reasons ..as they work hard even after the logout time ... A person works because he have some financial problems at home but even at your emergency situation here leave is very hard to get ..</i></b></p><br><br>
